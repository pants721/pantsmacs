# Pantsmacs Wishlist
> Packages that look interesting or that I think would be cool to integrate into pantsmacs.

## [Try](https://github.com/larstvei/try)
Lets you try emacs packages without installing them.

Notes:
- I constantly try new packages so it would be helpful for this whole sorta thing

## [Avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy)
Kangaroo.emacs

Notes:
- Looks interesting

## [straight.el](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el)
straight.el: next-generation, purely functional package manager for the Emacs hacker.

Notes:
- Everyone and their mother says to use this, but it seems like it might take 30 mins to switch.

## [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu)
Company alternative by the vertico guy

Notes:
- Company gives me some trouble so a replacement seems good
- Vertico and consult seem consistent in a way I appreciate
- Would probably help to switch to vertico

## [vertico](https://github.com/minad/vertico)
Ivy alternative

Notes:
- Vertico has very specific hangup's for me when I try to transition to it from ivy
- Fast and good
- Weird ^ thing in the prompt

## [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult)
Counsel alternative

Notes:
- I don't really care for counsel to begin with
- Has theme live previews

## [marginalia](https://github.com/minad/marginalia/)
Honestly i dont know

Notes:
- I don't understand it, but its part of this whole vertico-consult ecosystem so give it a look

## [no-littering](https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering)
Keeps ~/.emacs.d clean

Notes:
- I like keeping emacs clean so this is very intriguing

## [evil-mc](https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc)
Multi-cursor

Notes:
- I've used it before, I've just been too lazy to implement it

## [web-mode](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode)
Frontend shit

Notes:
- I'll install this on the cursed day I have to do frontend development

## org
org

Notes:
- I need to actually learn org-mode

## [sudo-edit](https://github.com/nflath/sudo-edit)
Does what it says on the box

Notes:
- Want to use emacs for sys files

## [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile)
Project managment

Notes:
- I am tired of (x-major-mode starting in project root "~")
